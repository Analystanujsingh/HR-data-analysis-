# HR Data Analysis

## Description
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files (`Hr data analytics.ipynb` and `Hr data analysis.ipynb`) for HR data analysis and visualization, focusing on employee demographics, factors affecting attrition, and workforce insights.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - bokeh (if using Bokeh for visualization)

## File Structure
- `Hr data analytics.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file for detailed HR data analysis.
- `Hr data analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file focusing on HR data analytics.
- `HR_Analytics.csv`: Sample HR dataset (replace this with your own dataset).

## Data Analysis
Both `Hr data analytics.ipynb` and `Hr data analysis.ipynb` cover the following aspects:

### Data Preprocessing
- Loading and cleaning the HR dataset.
- Handling missing values and duplicates.
- Outlier detection and treatment.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzing employee demographics (age, gender, education, marital status).
- Investigating factors influencing attrition, such as overtime, job role, and satisfaction levels.

### Visualizations
- Utilizing Matplotlib and Bokeh to generate visualizations:
  - Bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and area charts displaying various insights.
  - Stacked bar charts representing employee demographics by different attributes.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Analystanujsingh.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib bokeh`
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook files (`Hr data analytics.ipynb` or `Hr data analysis.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
